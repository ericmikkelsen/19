The following information is provided by the Alameda County Public Health Department in their [PDF on What You Should Know About the Coronavirus (COVID-19)](http://www.acphd.org/media/557832/about-covid-19-hch-flyer.pdf).

## What should I do if I get sick?

* If you have a fever and cough, you should stay away from other people as much as you can. Do not go to public areas and avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, or use your elbow, not your hand. 
* Use a facemask if you have one when you are around other people, to help prevent the spread of viruses to them.
* If you can, clean frequently touched objects and surfaces using a household cleaning spray or wipe.
* There is no need to go to the doctor unless you have shortness of breath or other symptoms beyond regular flu or cold.
